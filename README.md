## First things first

If you are reading this md file is because we are so glad to invite you to enjoy our hiring process and congratulations, because it means that you passed the first step.

## The Challenge

Now it's time to code. This is the starter code to you to build your Weather App. You need to fork this project and develop/commit by your own. The challenge is simple, we need a simple application that lists and show us the weather forecast for today in 5 cities of your choice (feel free to select the most interesting city for you). Basicaly, the user will interact with the interface clicking on the city list and we expect that this action will show to the user the forecast for today. The minimum information that we expect to be shown is temperature in celcius but you are free to be creative and surprise everyone with a beautiful interface and ritch information.
If you are asking yourself where will you collect forecast informations, we recomend to use [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Deadline
You have 72 houres (3 days) to send the link to the result of your implementations by e-mail to victor.ximenis@smilego.com.br
